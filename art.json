This life-size steel sculpture was given to the City and County of Honolulu, by Mr. and Mrs. Paul Saviskas, in honor of all the endangered seals worldwide. The seal is based on a news story from the Pupukea beach area of Oahu, whereby a mother seal lost her seal pup in the ocean and kept searching for the pup. The rocks originally crated with the sculpture as received from the artist are Hawaiian bluestone from the island of Hawaii and are intended to be installed with the figure.",
